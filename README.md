## 📌 Key Findings from Dashboard

- 🏙️ Countries like the U.S., Spain, South Africa, and Thailand have high CO2 emissions in the building sector, indicating a pressing need for sustainable infrastructure.  
- 📖 Germany ranks highest in literacy, while Argentina, New Zealand, and Japan lead in urbanization. Rural trends dominate in Nepal and Sri Lanka.  
- 🌊 Earthquake risk is high in Afghanistan, Korea, and Myanmar, while tsunami vulnerability is significant in Thailand and Finland.  
- 🍱 Some countries show strong food supply despite low urbanization, hinting at agricultural focus or food export strategies.  
- 🚿 Sanitation service access is more widespread than drinking water in many regions, highlighting infrastructure gaps.  
- 🧠 Bhutan and Pakistan have lower adult literacy levels—indicating opportunities for educational investment.  
- 👷 Urban population growth doesn’t always correlate with job absorption; some countries face growing urban unemployment.  
- 📈 Food supply trends over time show both growth and decline patterns, influenced by external shocks or development.  
- 📊 Higher per capita food supply aligns positively with literacy and employment indicators in many countries.  
- 📦 Food supply distribution across nations shows modest disparity—median levels are fairly balanced.  
- 🍰 The top 10 countries with the highest food supply demonstrate nutritional wealth and possible overproduction.  
- 💰 GDP per capita often correlates with urbanization rate—particularly among developed nations.  
- 💧 Access to sanitation and water has improved, but policy focus varies across countries and years.

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

- **Policymakers**: Identify underserved sectors across energy, education, or sanitation  
- **NGOs**: Use food-labor-literacy correlations to design targeted interventions  
- **Urban Planners**: Benchmark sustainable city models using emissions vs urban growth  
- **Climate Researchers**: Monitor building-related emissions trends  
- **Educators**: Visualize literacy, food, and infrastructure equity gaps
